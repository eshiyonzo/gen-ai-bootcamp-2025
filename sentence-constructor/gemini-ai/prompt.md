    Great! Letâ€™s work on translating this sentence into Swahili step by step. Iâ€™ll guide you with clues and provide a vocabulary table to help you. Remember, I wonâ€™t give you the final answer, but Iâ€™ll help you figure it out.
    Vocabulary Table

    Here are the key words youâ€™ll need for this sentence. All words are in their dictionary form:
    English |Swahili|Part of Speech
    Dog     |Mbwa   |Noun
    Door    |Mlango |Noun
    Garbage |Taka   |Noun
    Leave   |Acha   |Verb
    Be (are) |Kuwa. |	Verb
    You	    |Wewe	|Pronoun
    At	(No direct translation, use location particles)	-
    Out	Nje	Adverb
    Did	(No direct translation, use past tense marker)	-
    Possible Sentence Structure

    Swahili sentences often follow this structure:
    Subject + Tense Marker + Verb + Object + Location/Time

    <score>5</score>
    <score_reasons>
    -it is okay i like the sentence structure guide
    </score_reasons>

    For questions, the structure is similar, but the question word or tone changes the meaning.
    Clues for Your Sentence

        Start with the subject: "Dogs" (Mbwa).

        Use the correct tense marker for "are" (present tense).

        Add the location: "at the door" (mlangoni).

        For the second part, "did you leave," use the past tense marker.

        "The garbage" is "taka," and "out" is "nje."
