    For questions, the structure is similar, but the question word or tone changes the meaning.

        Start with the subject: "Dogs" (Mbwa).

        Use the correct tense marker for "are" (present tense).

        Add the location: "at the door" (mlangoni).

        For the second part, "did you leave," use the past tense marker.

        "The garbage" is "taka," and "out" is "nje."
